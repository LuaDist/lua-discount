# lua-discount

A binding to [Discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/), a 
fast C implementation of the 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) text to HTML markup 
system. Discount passes the Markdown test suite.

## Performance
Thanks to the underlying Discount implementation, lua-discount is incredibly 
fast. Benchmarking markdown.lua 0.32 against lua-discount 1.2.10 by parsing 
the [Markdown syntax 
document](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text) 100 times 
gives the following result (all figures are in seconds):

                       user     system      total       real
    lua-discount   0.170000   0.000000   0.170000   0.177374
    markdown.lua  48.530000   0.000000  48.530000  48.524910

## [Usage](id:usage)
Note that `require("discount")` returns a single function, which you are 
responsible for giving a suitable name. Example:

    discount = require("discount")

    local markdown_string = [[
      # Demonstration
      This is a demonstration of lua-discount. Passing the options `"nolinks"` 
      disables links such as [this](http://example.com).
      ]]
      
      local html_string = discount(markdown_string, "nolinks")

The `discount` function takes as its first argument the Markdown string to 
convert, and for its subsequent arguments takes any combination of the 
following strings as options:

=`"nolinks"`=
    do not allow `<a` or expand Markdown links.
=`"noimages"`=
    do not allow `<img` or expand Markdown images.
=`"nopants"`=
    disable [SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) 
    processing.
=`"nohtml"`=
    disallow embedded html by replacing all `<` with `&lt;`.
=`"tagtext"`=
    don't expand `*` or `_` when used for emphasis.
=`"noext"`=
    do not process 
    [pseudo-protocols](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/#pseudo)
=`"cdata"`=
    generate output suitable for use as data in an XML document.
= `"embed"`=
    equivalent to specifying `"nolinks"`, `"noimages"` and `"tagtext"`.
